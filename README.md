### Setup
(If using nvm use `nvm use` else recommended to install version mentioned in `.nvmrc`)

1. Install dependencies with `npm install`
2. Start the server with `npm start`

### Info
.nvmrc is added to maintain the node version to prevent any unknown issues with another version.
I have added tailwind to make the ui styling easy and promote class reusability. Added package tabler icons for small icons.
The API requests might appear twice but that would be due to React Strict Mode on Dev environment. It is not a bug.
